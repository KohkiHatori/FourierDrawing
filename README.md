## üßÆ Mathematical Foundation

FourierDrawing is built on the mathematical principle that any closed curve can be decomposed into a series of rotating complex vectors. This approach leverages the fundamental theorem of Fourier analysis, which states that periodic functions can be expressed as infinite sums of sinusoidal components.

### Core Concepts

**Fourier Series Decomposition**: The application transforms input curves into their frequency domain representation, where each frequency corresponds to a rotating vector with specific amplitude and phase characteristics.

**Complex Vector Representation**: Each point on the original curve is represented as the sum of complex exponential functions, where the rotation speed of each vector corresponds to its harmonic frequency.

**Coefficient Extraction**: The system calculates Fourier coefficients through analytical integration of B√©zier curve segments, employing integration by parts techniques for both linear and cubic curve types.

**Path Synthesis**: The original curve is reconstructed by vector summation at discrete time intervals, creating the animated drawing effect where each vector contributes to the final traced path.

### Implementation Details

The mathematical framework handles:
- Parametric curve representation using B√©zier mathematics
- Complex number arithmetic for rotation calculations  
- Frequency domain analysis for optimal vector ordering
- Geometric transformations for screen coordinate mapping

**For detailed mathematical formulations, equations, and theoretical background, please refer to `Specification.pdf` included in this repository.**
